## Features

- Works across the entire [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) stack
  - Dashboard
  - Add project
  - Add equipment
  - Environment variables automatically assigned to Vercel project

## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://techdoc-builder.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This+starter+configures+Supabase+Auth+to+use+cookies%2C+making+the+user%27s+session+available+throughout+the+entire+Next.js+app+-+Client+Components%2C+Server+Components%2C+Route+Handlers%2C+Server+Actions+and+Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Clone the project

3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API PUBLISHABLE OR ANON KEY]
  ```
  > [!NOTE]
  > This example uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, which refers to Supabase's new **publishable** key format.
  > Both legacy **anon** keys and new **publishable** keys can be used with this variable name during the transition period. Supabase's dashboard may show `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`; its value can be used in this example.
  > See the [full announcement](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29260) for more information.

  Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true)

4. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.
